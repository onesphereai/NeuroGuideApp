# Important Information About Attune's Arousal Detection

**For Parents and Caregivers**

---

## What Attune Does

Attune uses your device's camera and microphone to observe your child's movement, facial expressions, and voice patterns. It then provides real-time coaching suggestions to help you support your child's emotional regulation.

### How It Works

The app looks at:
- **Movement patterns** - How active or still your child is
- **Facial expressions** - Changes in expression that may signal arousal shifts
- **Voice characteristics** - Pitch, volume, and tone changes

It combines these signals to estimate your child's arousal level and offers strategies matched to what it observes.

## Important Limitations You Should Know

###  This is Experimental Technology

Attune's arousal detection system has **NOT been clinically validated** with autistic children. This means:

- We don't know how accurate it is compared to expert clinical assessment
- It hasn't been tested in formal research studies with diverse autistic children
- The algorithm is based on general theories and principles, not autism-specific data

**What this means for you:**
- Trust your own observations and knowledge of your child above the app
- Don't rely on Attune for safety-critical decisions
- Consider it an experimental tool to try, not proven medical technology

### ️ Every Autistic Child is Unique

The autism spectrum is incredibly diverse. What works for one child may not work for another.

**Attune may not work well for children who:**
- Have significant movement differences or motor challenges
- Use minimal facial expressions or have "flat affect"
- Are minimally verbal or nonverbal
- Have co-occurring conditions affecting movement or expression
- Stim frequently (app might misinterpret joyful stimming as high arousal)

**What this means for you:**
- Results may be less accurate for some children than others
- You'll need to learn what Attune gets right and wrong for YOUR child
- Consider discontinuing use if it's not helpful for your family

### Baseline Calibration is Important (But Optional)

For the most accurate results, Attune needs to learn your child's typical patterns when calm. This is called "baseline calibration."

**Without baseline calibration:**
- The app uses generic thresholds that may not fit your child
- A naturally active child might be constantly flagged as "high arousal"
- A naturally quiet child might never trigger early warnings

**With baseline calibration:**
- Thresholds are adjusted to your child's individual patterns
- More accurate detection of true arousal shifts (not just their baseline)

**What this means for you:**
- Complete baseline calibration in profile settings for best results
- Re-calibrate every 30 days as your child grows and changes
- Even with calibration, the system isn't perfect

### Technology Has Blind Spots

The app uses computer vision (AI that "sees") and audio analysis. These technologies have limitations:

**The app may struggle with:**
- Poor lighting conditions
- Multiple people in frame (might confuse who to track)
- Background noise masking vocal patterns
- Unusual camera angles
- Fast-moving children (motion blur)

**The app cannot detect:**
- Internal sensations (stomach ache, headache, hunger)
- Triggers not visible on camera (strong smells, uncomfortable clothing tags)
- Complex emotions (frustration vs. excitement may look similar)
- Thoughts or mental distress without physical signs

**What this means for you:**
- Use Attune as ONE source of information, not the only one
- Continue to watch for other signs and trust your instincts
- Environmental factors matter (good lighting, clear view of child)

### Not All Movement is Distress

Autistic children move their bodies in many ways, and movement serves many functions:

- **Stimming** - Self-soothing, joy, concentration, communication
- **Sensory seeking** - Meeting sensory needs (not always dysregulation)
- **Playful energy** - Happy, engaged, excited movement

**The challenge:**
- Attune might sometimes flag happy, regulatory movement as "high arousal"
- We're working to distinguish different types of movement, but it's hard

**What this means for you:**
- If the app says "orange zone" but your child is happily jumping, trust your eyes
- Use the app's suggestions as possibilities, not commands
- You know your child best - override the app when needed

## How to Use Attune Responsibly

### ✅ Good Ways to Use Attune

- As a learning tool to notice patterns you might have missed
- To try new regulation strategies suggested by the app
- To track which strategies work well for your child over time
- As a second pair of eyes during busy or stressful moments
- To have objective data to share with your child's therapy team (if desired)

### ❌ Poor Ways to Use Attune

- Relying solely on the app and ignoring your instincts
- Using it to "prove" your child is or isn't dysregulated (override your judgment)
- Showing arousal readings to your child in a way that feels judgmental
- Forcing interventions your child rejects, just because the app suggests them
- Using it during truly private moments (toileting, dressing, medical care)

### Tips for Success

1. **Start slowly** - Use it a few times and see how it feels
2. **Calibrate thoughtfully** - Do baseline calibration during genuinely calm moments
3. **Learn the patterns** - Notice what the app gets right and wrong for your child
4. **Stay in control** - You decide whether to follow suggestions or not
5. **Involve your child (if appropriate)** - Older children might like to see their arousal patterns and choose strategies
6. **Take breaks** - It's okay to turn it off and trust yourself

## Neurodiversity-Affirming Values

Attune is built on the principle that **autism is a natural form of human diversity**, not a disease to cure.

Our approach:
- **Accommodation over conformity** - Suggests environmental changes, not behavior suppression
- **Respects stimming** - Recognizes self-regulatory behaviors as helpful, not "problematic"
- **Values communication** - All behavior is communication; our job is to understand
- **Centers the child's experience** - Prioritizes the child's comfort and consent
- **Supports the whole family** - Recognizes parent well-being is crucial for co-regulation

**You'll never see:**
- Suggestions to stop "autistic behaviors"
- Goals of making your child "look normal"
- Blame or shame for meltdowns or dysregulation
- Compliance-focused language ("make them obey")

**You will see:**
- Suggestions to modify the environment (reduce noise, dim lights)
- Recognition that meltdowns are not manipulation
- Support for YOU to stay calm (so you can help them regulate)
- Respect for your child's sensory needs and communication style

## Questions & Answers

### Q: What if the app says "orange zone" but my child seems fine?

**A:** Trust your eyes. The app may be wrong due to:
- Happy, energetic movement misinterpreted as high arousal
- Stimming flagged as dysregulation
- Poor lighting or camera angle
- Your child's baseline is different from the default thresholds

Override the app and note the false alarm. This helps you learn when to trust it.

### Q: Should I show my child their arousal readings?

**A:** It depends on your child. For some children, seeing visual feedback is helpful self-awareness. For others, it might feel judgmental or cause anxiety.

**Try it carefully if:**
- Your child expresses interest
- They benefit from visual information
- You frame it neutrally ("Your body has big energy right now") not judgmentally

**Avoid it if:**
- Your child feels monitored or controlled
- It increases their anxiety or self-consciousness
- They don't want to participate

### Q: Can I use Attune in school or therapy sessions?

**A:** Technically yes, but:
- Get permission from teachers/therapists first
- Consider privacy of other children (don't record them)
- Make sure it doesn't interfere with learning or therapy
- Check school policies on recording/AI use

The app is primarily designed for home use with parents.

### Q: What if my child doesn't want to be recorded?

**A:** Respect their autonomy. Children have a right to privacy, and forcing recording can damage trust.

Consider:
- Explaining why you want to use it and asking permission (if child can understand)
- Only using it during agreed-upon times
- Not using it if they object
- Finding other ways to support regulation without technology

Consent matters, even for kids.

### Q: Will this replace our therapists or support services?

**A:** Absolutely not. Attune is a supplementary tool, like a parenting book or blog - it offers ideas, but it doesn't replace individualized professional support.

Think of it as:
- A coach in your pocket for everyday moments
- A pattern-tracking tool to discuss with your therapy team
- A source of strategy ideas to try

Not as:
- A diagnostic tool
- A treatment or intervention protocol
- A substitute for professional assessment or therapy
